# Accumulative Interest Forwarding (AIF)
This repository contains the implementation of Accumulative Interest Forwarding (AIF) scheme which I had proposed for my MS thesis. I had proposed it with the perspective of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Using AIF, a WSN node will be able to send lesser number of Interest packets saving its energy. This will also lead to many other improvements which would eventually increase the Network Lifetime. 
The scheme is implemented using ndnSIM. ndnSIM is the simulator for Named-Data Networking (NDN) experimentation.
